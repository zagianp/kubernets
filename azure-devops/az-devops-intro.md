1. What is Azure DevOps?
Azure DevOps is an all-inclusive package offering a wide-ranging service that covers the entire SDLC or Application development life cycle. Let’s see some substantial features of the Azure DevOps:

Azure Boards: Allows Work item tracking, Agile planning, Power BI visualization, and similar other reporting tools.
Azure Pipelines: Defines CI/CD- Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment process with support for containers and Kubernetes.
Azure Repos: Provides full-support for cloud-hosted private repositories.
Azure Artifacts: Package management Support for Maven, npm, NuGet and Python package feeds from private or public sources.
Azure Test Plans: Provides integrated planning and investigation of testing solutions.
Azure DevOps is the feature-rich mature model offered by Microsoft for businesses to simultaneously manage multiple tasks.

2. What is the Azure Pipeline?
Azure Pipeline is an automated set of processes that helps developers to compile, build, and deploy codes on other computation platforms. It is a continuous delivery tool similar to open source Jenkins or CodeShip. The sole goal of this pipeline is that there is no manual intervention, all the changes are automatically executed in the project. Whenever humans are handling the process, there is a possibility of human errors while doing the same repetitive boring tasks, but with automation, it works seamlessly once it’s configured.

A pipeline is normally broken down into the following categories:

Source Control
Build Tools
Package creation
Configuration management
Monitoring
This Pipeline can be used with many application types such as Java, Go, Python, JavaScript, Node.js, .Net, C++ and XCode. To use it , you will need a source control to attach with it. Moreover, it supports various source controls such as GitHub, Azure Repos, Bitbucket, Subversion, etc.

This pipeline is based on the strong foundations of CI/CD pipelines which consistently test, build and deploy. They also perform constant deliveries automatically by continuous testing and deploying the codes to the desired targets in the project.

Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration helps to catch the bugs and issues in the early stage of the development cycle when fixing errors is simpler and fast. Developers can check their codes in version-controlled repositories, check-in their code to test and locate errors. The main benefits are:

Minor changes are easier to merge in large codes.
Easier for big teams to see what each one has been working on.
Locate bugs and make them easier to fix.
Continuous code compilation and testing.
Making the integration process smooth thus improves productivity.
Continuous Delivery (CD)
Continuous Delivery is the process of integrating code with infrastructure, ensuring that all tests are performed and policies are followed, and finally deploying the code into the desired environment.CD helps developers to deliver new features, fix bugs and configure changes reliably and quickly. CD pipeline provides routine deliveries as per configuration or can also be called on-demand. The key benefits are:

Decreases risks in releases.
Faster delivery of bug fixes and issues.
Delivery can be feasible at any scale.
Azure Pipelines provides YAML syntax and a classic interface to setup CI-CD pipelines.

3. Advantages of Using Azure DevOps Pipeline:
Azure pipeline includes a variety of elements and when implied with Azure DevOps CI/CD practice, Azure DevOps Pipeline offers many benefits to the user. Some of them are as mentioned below:

Version Control Systems – The first thing you need to do to create an Azure CI/CD pipeline is to put your code in a version control system. Any kind of Git repository including GitHub, Github Enterprise, Subversion, Bitbucket Cloud, and more can help you manage your source code. Developers are also known to leverage it to support Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).
Programming Languages and types of Application – With the Azure DevOps pipeline, you can use it with most application types and various kinds of programming languages including Javascript, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, and so on. It can be used with any platform like Linux, Windows, and macOS.
Deployment Targets – You can deploy Azure CI/CD pipelines with apps on environments with multiple targets like any On-prem or cloud platform, virtual machines, container registries, Azure services, containers, etc.
Pricing – If you are working on a public project then the Azure DevOps pipeline comes free of charge but in the case of private projects you have to subscribe to its services not before you run up to 1800 minutes of pipeline jobs for free every month.
Progressive Deployment – During the development and testing phase, the Azure DevOps pipeline allows you to set as many stages as you want to control the quality of the project before you have to move on to the next stage. This helps you in accurately pinpointing the bugs and understanding the problems, where they are occurring, and how to solve them. The completely customized deployment controls of the Azure DevOps pipeline not only keep you in the controlling position for your project but also enable you to make deliberate delivery of CI/CD solutions to the client.
4. Define Pipelines Using YAML Syntax
YAML syntax
The pipeline depends on the versioning of the code, similar codes will have a similar branching structure. You can set triggers to start the process when any pull request is accepted. You can trigger the build process and identify issues in integration with your existing codebase.

azure-pipelines.yml can be used to add your pipeline in a YAML file with your application.

These are the high-level steps:

Configure Azure Pipeline to use your repository.
Edit the YAML file to specify your build.
Push your code in a specific branch to trigger the process.
5. Define Pipelines Using Classic Interface
Classic Interface
Users can define the pipeline in the Azure DevOps portal with the classic editor. They can also define a “Build Pipeline” for such activities as to build and test your code, and then publish artifacts. Additionally, they can also define the “Release Pipeline” to consume these artifacts and deploy them in targets.

These are the high-level steps:

Configure Azure DevOps Pipeline to use your repository.
Define build and release pipelines using the Azure DevOps web portal.
Push your code to a specific branch to trigger the process.
Here, we saw high levels of steps to define pipelines in both ways. Let see a few terms to be used in Azure DevOps Pipelines before we jump to create a new pipeline.

6. Key Components of Azure DevOps Pipeline
Key components
A triggerinitiates an Azure DevOps Pipeline to run.
A pipeline can have many stages. A pipeline can deploy to single or multiple environments.
A stage can be specified to manage jobs in a pipeline and each stage has various jobs.
Each job runs on one agent. It’s also possible that a job doesn’t have an agent.
Each agent runs a job that may have various steps.
A step can be anything like a script or task and it is the compact part of a pipeline.
A task is a pre-bundled script that acts like to publish a build artifact or to call a REST API.
A run publishes a bunch of files or bundles called an artifact.
Agents and Agent pools
An Agent is a computing architecture with installed agent software that runs a set of steps when a job attached to the agent runs. Rather than handling each agent separately, you group them into agent pools. For detailed information on this component check- Build and release agents.

Approvals
It specifies a set of validations needed before a deployment can be executed. It is used to manage deployments to production environments. Once checks are configured, the pipelines will pause and stop before starting the deployment process. They will only restart the process once all the uncheck options are checked and completed successfully. For any information, visit Define Approvals and checks.

Artifacts
Artifacts are a bundle of packages or files published by build pipelines. They let the team quickly collect the dependencies and other artifacts required for the application development. Also, you can utilize diverse artifacts like Build Artifacts, Maven, Nuget, PyPI, Universal Packages, etc. Learn more about Artifacts in Azure Pipelines.

Trigger
A trigger is considered as a setup for letting the pipeline know when to operate. Experts can configure a pipeline to work against a force to the repository or at scheduled times. Therefore, these mentioned operations are perceived as triggers. For further information, explore build triggers and release triggers.

Deployment group
It is a series of target machines that have agents installed. Setting a deployment target for pipelines in machines is easy with the deployment group. See more about deployment groups.

Environment
When a bundle of different resources comes together and deploys the application then it is called an environment. It can be a collection of various resources such as virtual machines, containers, web apps or any services.

Job
The stage consists of many jobs, each job is run by an agent. Job defines an execution boundary for a set of steps to be performed.

Pipeline
The Pipeline is a part of the CI/CD process where there are numerous stages. You can imagine it as a workflow in a sequential form where you run tests, build and deploy your app.

Run
A run command is used to implement any function in a pipeline. It gathers the logs linked with the steps currently running and the results of the tests are currently implemented. In the course of a run, pipelines will first evaluate the pipeline and then transfer the run to various agents. Jobs will be executed by each agent. See more about the pipeline run sequence.

Script
A script can be a Bash, command line or PowerShell that runs code in your pipeline.

Stage
In a pipeline, there is a logical perimeter for monitoring performance which is called Stage.

Task
A task is a bundled script or method that has been engrossed with a pair of inputs.
